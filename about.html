                                <li>To help good programmers get even better. </li>
                                <li>To create a sense of pair-programming with an AI collaborator that can contribute just like a colleague.</li>
                                <li>To reduce errors.</li>

                        <p><img class="bots-left" src="images/robots/6.png">Code Drone started over 5 years ago, the research and development teams worked really hard to get a prototype working in about 2 years, it took another 2 years to really refine how we use Machine Learning (ML), Neural Networks (NN), Deep Learning (DL), Big Data to interface with code drone and the programmer.
                    
                        <p>Code drone had gained some popularity before hitting the market through appearances, on Reddit, TED talks, Hacker Noon, and Wired. We’ve also presented virtually at several tech conferences. </p>

                        <h3> What's next for code drone?</h3>
            
                        <p><img class="bots-right" src="images/robots/7.png">That’s a really interesting question… Code drone has been out for a year now learning, teaching, and growing. His data center has grown much faster than we anticipated, and the models are constantly adjusting to the shifting to the various landscapes and scenarios, to offer the best AI-assisted coding technology, all companies are a little different culturally and goal-wise. I think code drone will eventually branch out into new areas where AI assistance makes sense in a non-invasive way, where it can be overlayed and connected with employees doing much of what it does already but in other contexts, think - manufacturing, research, human resources, legal, medical, government, education, finance. These are where I see code drone going in the next 5 years, and rebranded as we’ll he’ll be evolved, more grown-up, and solving a more diverse widespread set of problems with colleagues across many sectors. </p>
